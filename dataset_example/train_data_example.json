This makes it a significant adverse prognostic factor. Vascular invasion is associated with a higher likelihood of distant metastasis, as the invaded vessels can act as pathways for cancer cells to disseminate and potentially form secondary tumors in other organs. As a result, patients with vascular invasion often have a higher risk of recurrence and a poorer overall prognosis compared to those without. "
